# Pixel Partisan #

A simple, small pixel editor running on Flash Player 9 and up.

## Why bother and why Flash Player 9? ##

Because there seems to be no pixel precise application for Maemo (that is all that are out there either don't have zoom or if they do, the zooming uses bilinear interpolation), and I happen to use Nokia N900 which sports Maemo. That's why. :-)
